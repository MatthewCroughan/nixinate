# Nixinate üï∂Ô∏è

Nixinate is a proof of concept that generates a deployment script for each
`nixosConfiguration` you already have in your flake, which can be ran via `nix
run`, thanks to the `apps` attribute of the [flake
schema](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Flake_schema).

## Usage

To add and configure `nixinate` in your own flake, you need to:

1. Add the result of `nixinate self` to the `apps` attribute of your flake.
2. Add and configure `_module.args.nixinate` to the `nixosConfigurations` you want to deploy

Below is a minimal example:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-23.05";
    nixinate.url = "github:matthewcroughan/nixinate";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, nixinate }: {
    apps = nixinate.nixinate.x86_64-linux self;
    nixosConfigurations = {
      myMachine = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
        system = "x86_64-linux";
        modules = [
          (import ./my-configuration.nix)
          {
            _module.args.nixinate = {
              host = "itchy.scratchy.com";
              sshUser = "matthew";
              buildOn = "remote"; # valid args are "local" or "remote"
              substituteOnTarget = true; # if buildOn is "local" then it will substitute on the target, "-s"
              hermetic = false;
            };
          }
          # ... other configuration ...
        ];
      };
    };
  };
}
```

Each `nixosConfiguration` you have configured should have a deployment script in
`apps.nixinate`, visible in `nix flake show` like this:

```
$ nix flake show
git+file:///etc/nixos
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄapps
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄnixinate
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄmyMachine: app
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄnixosConfigurations
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄmyMachine: NixOS configuration
```

To finally execute the deployment script, use `nix run .#apps.nixinate.myMachine`

#### Example Run

```
[root@myMachine:/etc/nixos]# nix run .#apps.nixinate.myMachine

# Available arguments via `_module.args.nixinate`

- `host` *`string`*

   A string representing the hostname or IP address of a machine to connect to
   via ssh.

- `port` *`number`*

   A number representing the port of the machine to connect to, by default set to 22

- `sshUser` *`string`*

   A string representing the username a machine to connect to via ssh.

- `buildOn` *`"remote"`* or *`"local"`*

  - `"remote"`

    Push the flake to the remote, build and activate entirely remotely,
    returning logs via SSH.

  - `"local"`

    Build the system closure locally, copy to the remote and activate.

- `hermetic` *`bool`*

  Whether to copy Nix to the remote for usage when building and activating,
  instead of using the Nix which is already installed on the remote.

- `substituteOnTarget` *`bool`*

  Whether to fetch closures and paths from the remote, even when building
  locally. This makes sense in most cases, because the remote will have already
  built a lot of the paths from the previous deployment. However, if the remote
  has a slow upload bandwidth, this would not be a good idea to enable.

# Project Principles

* No Premature Optimization: Make it work, then optimize it later if the
  optimization is taking a lot of time to figure out now.
* KISS: Keep it simple, stupid. Unnecesary complexity should be avoided.
